# Silon

Cluster + contrast + dominate + optimize 

Don't sweat the small stuff. When you can't distinquish
between

Give me the fruitful error any time, full of seeds, bursting with its own corrections. You can keep your sterile truth for yourself.    
--  Vilfredo Pareto


Less is more.   
-- Dieter Rams

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.  
-- Leonardo da Vinci

The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.   
-- William James
